## 💀 What is `bugscan-mr`?

`bugscan-mr` is a **lethal recon and CDN hunter** engineered for maximum chaos. It tears through domains, IP ranges, and APKs like a beast in the shadows—**exposing secrets, endpoints, and vulnerabilities buried deep within digital infrastructure**.

This is not your average scanner—**it’s a weapon** wrapped in a dark, blazing-fast terminal experience.
